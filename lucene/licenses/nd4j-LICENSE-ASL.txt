The initial code for shuffling an array (originally in class 
"org.apache.commons.math3.random.RandomDataGenerator", now replaced by a method in 
class "org.apache.commons.math3.util.MathArrays") was inspired from the algorithm 
description provided in "Algorithms", by Ian Craw and John Pulham (University of 
Aberdeen 1999). The textbook (containing a proof that the shuffle is uniformly random) 
is available here:
